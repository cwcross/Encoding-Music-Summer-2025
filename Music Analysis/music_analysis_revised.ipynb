    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be using LangChain and OpenAI to evaluate a Large Language Model's (LLM's) ability to analyze music. To do this, we will be exploring the LLM's capabilities by touching on each of the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Get Tabular Data from MEI (Music Encoding Initiative).**  We sort of know it can already do this:  returning tables of all the notes in each voice part.  Can it do so also with the octave information?  Same thing for durations.  Then I suppose we might ask it to calculate things, like the range of a piece, or the distribution of notes.  See subsequent ideas about finding ‘pieces with similar distributions to this one’.  \n",
    "* **Work with metadata in the MEI files.**  Tell us something about which ones are most similar in terms of sources, editors, composers.  A structured output, I suppose, like a database of pieces based on metadata in them.  \n",
    "* **Get Text from MEI and Recreate It.**  Lyrics are also elements in MEI (and MusicXML)  of course they are distributed among different vocal lines in the case of Renaissance music, and there are lots of word repetitions.  Could we recover the text and then use LLM to put into shape (as a rhymed poem, or something like that?).  Could they LLM use the placement of rests as a way to understand the form?  \n",
    "* **Could it Guess the Key.** of a piece from the distribution or proportion of pitches?  What would it need to know from us in order to do this?  Could it tell us which pieces are the least tonal, or least easy to rank by key?  Can it tell us if a piece changes key along the way?  (Hint:  not using key signature directly).  \n",
    "* **Rank Pieces by Difficulty.**  Things with lots of changes of direction, or wide leaps, or difficult rhythms, etc.  The Bartok pieces are in fact pedagogical (and even in order). \n",
    "* **Extract editorial feature data from files.** this would involve both editorial and music feature data.  The CRIM files (and lots of other MEI files of early music) have things like Musica Ficta in them.  These are editorial accidentals applied according to various rules of counterpoint.  Could the tool tell us about where these appear, which composers and editors make use of them?  Could it also produced some structured data for this, like a report or table?  \n",
    "\n",
    "During these tests, we are using a sample of 9 mei files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Invention No. 1 in C major - Bach, Johann Sebastian\n",
    "* Invention No. 7 in E minor - Bach, Johann Sebastian\n",
    "* Invention No. 15 in B minor - Bach, Johann Sebastian\n",
    "* Mikrokosmos No. 22: Imitation and Counterpoint - Bartók, Béla\n",
    "* Mikrokosmos No. 31: Little Dance in Canon Form - Bartók, Béla\n",
    "* Mikrokosmos No. 104: Wandering through the Keys - Bartók, Béla\n",
    "* Go ye my canzonettes - Morley, Thomas\n",
    "* Leave now mine eyes - Morley, Thomas\n",
    "* Flora wilt thou - Morley, Thomas\n",
    "\n",
    "For the LLM with tools, we feed the LLM a basic dictionary with the title, composer, filepath, and number of parts. It then can use the filepath (after some manual parsing) to run Music21.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the llm without tools, we saved extended summary information as a JSON file. This JSON includes basic metadata, all of the pitches and intervals for each part, and the key. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the LLM music analysis in this experiment uses gpt-4o by OpenAI."

      "3. **Bartok_Mikrokosmos_104** - Complexity through key changes and use of accidentals.\n",
      "4. **Bach_BWV_0772** - Sufficient complexity through note density and Bach’s intricate counterpoint.\n",

      "Musica ficta refers to the practice in medieval and Renaissance music of adding accidentals or altering pitches that are not notated in the musical score. This was done primarily to avoid dissonance and to create smoother melodic lines or better cadential progressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the provided piece \"Veni speciosam\" by Johannes Lupi, instances of musica ficta may occur where you see alterations not explicitly written in the notation but implied based on the rules of counterpoint and performance practice of the period. A typical scenario where musica ficta might be applied is at cadences, where performers might raise the leading tone or alter pitches to facilitate smoother voice leading.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the given XML (Music Encoding Initiative) data, we can observe some pitches marked with accidentals (e.g., `<accid xml:id=\"m-151\" accid.ges=\"f\"/>`), indicating that the editor has applied these alterations, potentially following the practice of musica ficta. An example can be found in measures 4 through 7, where many `b` notes are marked with a flat accidental to avoid the tritone with the `f` note in F major or to create a smoother melodic line descending from `b` to `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach to applying musica ficta would be at cadential points. For instance, raising a leading tone in a minor key to better resolve at a cadence—the G in F major could be raised to avoid a diminished interval with the D (making it a G#) or to lead smoothly into an A.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to remember that musica ficta is often based on performer discretion, historical context, and stylistic judgment, rather than explicit notations in the score. Hence, while not everything applied in the XML denotes musica ficta, the adjustments serve the same purpose of altering pitch for smoother harmonic progression, according to Renaissance performance practice.\n"
