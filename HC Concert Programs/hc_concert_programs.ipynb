      "the piano concerto K. 414 is based on a movement in Bach’s overture La calamita de’cuori. His admiration for Bach began\n",
      "during a family trip to London in 1764-­‐65 when Mozart was only eight years old. During that trip he may have attended a\n",
      "performance of Bach’s opera Adriano in Siria, which premiered while the Mozart family was there. In 1777-­‐1778 Mozart\n",
      "visited Mannheim for several months hoping to secure a position with the court orchestra. Though unsuccessful, while\n",

      "The family patriarch, Angelo, had been (and remains) an ardent music lover, and Andrea wanted to commission a\n",
      "setting of Gigi’s text to give as a present. The verse layout already suggests musical treatment, as it alternates\n",
      "“solo” quatrains with “choral” ones. Parameters had already been proposed – a work for chorus, soprano solo,\n",
      "with a prominent (even virtuosic) organ part. Having already set Gigi’s sestinamento “Operistica” for soprano\n",
      "and piano, I welcomed the invitation to collaborate directly.\n",
      "I asked about Angelo’s tastes, and learned of his love for chant (especially Veni Creator Spiritus), Bach (and\n",

      "motif (you’ll notice that the poem itself is an acrostic) readily emerged and actually became a unifying element,\n",
      "sometimes juxtaposed with B – A – C – H, or the name of another contrapuntal pioneer, Arnold Schoenberg. The\n",

      "with Schumann). Two of the movements intentionally evoke the “neo-melodic” music that has been coming out\n",

      "Our program this afternoon offers three settings of texts from the biblical book of Psalms. Though all composed during a\n",
      "35-year period in the mid-20th Century, they differ dramatically in language (Latin, English, and the original Hebrew),\n",
      "musical style, and esthetic approach. Yet they also contain a number of unexpected congruities which become more\n",
      "apparent when heard side by side.\n",
      "Stravinsky had shocked the world with the cataclysmic primitivism of his 1913 Rite of Spring – an evocation of ancient\n",
      "rituals from pagan Russia. Following the final rupture of the composer’s relationship with his native Russia and a deeply\n",
      "personal reconnection to the Orthodox faith of his youth, the 1930 Symphony of Psalms again present a form of musical\n",
      "ritualism, but this time invoking the Eastern Rite Christian liturgies of his newly adopted religion. (After beginning the\n",
      "Symphony with ancient Church Slavonic texts, Stravinsky soon decided to change to the more familiar Latin of the\n",
      "Western church.)\n",
      "The music employs a more focused harmonic vocabulary and transparent use of the orchestra than in the Rite. The still\n",
      "unique orchestration for the Symphony of Psalms dispenses with the violins and violas altogether (Stravinsky felt that the\n",
      "string instruments were generally too suggestive of the more subjective esthetic of the Romantic era). More remarkable\n",
      "though are the distinctive choirs of woodwinds and brass in larger numbers than usual (five flutes, five oboes, four\n",
      "bassoons, five trumpets), usually heard independent of each other. The two central piano parts provide critical rhythmic\n",
      "underpinning and percussive color.\n",
      "The repetition of simple melodic and rhythmic motives around the same set of inter-related pitches creates an irresistable\n",
      "inner momentum. This is not music seeking to tell a story or draw a picture for the listener to be contemplated in a\n",
      "passive way. We are meant to be drawn into an event, in a totally “other” sacred time and place, where the emotional and\n",
      "spiritual energy of an anonymous crowd of worshippers subsumes individual expression.\n",
      "In three connected movements, the Symphony progresses from prayers of petition, to prayers of hope and promise in the\n",
      "second movement, and finally to praise in the extended final movment. The first, shortest movement begins with the\n",
      "choir in a sustained chant on the narrowest of melodic intervals over the repeated ostinatos of the orchestra. Desparate\n",
      "cries of Remitte mihi! and Ne sileas! (“spare me” and “do not be silent”) successively raise the clamor to a stark final\n",
      "cadence.\n",
      "The second movement follows in a much more restrained style, with a double fugue, one for the instruments of the\n",
      "orchestra followed by one for the choir, themes which are then combined. The final unison phrase of the choir chanting et\n",
      "sperabunt in Domino (“and they shall hope in the Lord”) leads to the canticum novum (“new song”) of the third\n",
      "movement with its opening “Alleluia.” This understated but luminous progression of three chords for “alleluia” is heard a\n",
      "symbolic three times, at the beginning, middle, and end of the final movement, unifying all the music heard around it in\n",
      "one simple gesture.\n",
      "The reverie of the opening Alleluia is broken by the sharply repeated chords of the horns. Twice we hear a brilliant clamor\n",
      "of flutes, oboes, pianos, and trumpets climbing the heights in what Stravinsky called (in a rare instance of acknowledged\n",
      "symbolism on his part) “Elijah riding to heaven in a chariot.”\n",
      "An expansive climactic phrase yields suddenly to a spacious closing processional and the final “Alleluia.” The psalmist\n",
      "calls on the instruments of the orchestra to sing their praise (Laudate Eum in timpano et choro). In one of the most\n",
      "sublime passages in Western music literature, all sense of time is suspended as alternating groups of 5 trumpets and 5\n",

      "in his London apartment in 1941 with bombs falling outside on the city. The soulful, blues-inflected opening melody is a\n",
      "perfect imbodiment of human longing for the divine, and the aching sense of its absence. Originally composed with organ\n",

      "venerating, saintly intercessors as it was in more overt displays of courtly magnificence.\n",
      "Like early fifteenth-century life itself, the music of Henry’s time is colourful and strikingly varied: a world of energy,\n",

      "deep contemplation and lyric beauty, designed to engender a mood of reverence and awe, as well as more conventional\n",
      "public utterances of a deliberately less sophisticated nature.\n",
      "The scene is set, as it was for so many royal and ecclesiastical entries, by the Te Deum, which in our performance combines\n",

      "remarkably rare pre-Reformation liturgical manuscript known as the Wollaton Antiphonal, where it forms part of a rhymed\n",
      "office for the saint. In tonight’s performance we present the elegantly poised Kyrie of the Mass, preceded by a selection of\n",
      "chants from the office, including the responsory that is heard, in long notes, as the cantus firmus of the polyphonic setting.\n",
      "Following this beautiful, contemplative work the more assertive grandeur of King Henry’s own Gloria makes a still more\n",
      "arresting impression than it would on its own. Whether, and to what degree, this impressive piece flowed actually from the\n",
      "quill of the King himself, it is striking enough that it was thought plausible by the scribe who assigned it to ‘Roy Henry’\n",
      "that it could have done so. Whether as composer or not, here we see evidence of the role of Henry as ‘Renaissance prince’,\n",
      "a strong figurehead in good times and bad, leading by example within his household chapel as convincingly as in court, in\n",
      "council, and on the field of combat.\n",
      "Of course the Lancastrian kings also cultivated a cluster of saints, dubbed by us ‘protectors of England,’ whose veneration\n",
      "was of long royal tradition. Invocation of St George sounds an obviously English and bellicose resonance, not to mention\n",
      "one that echoes with Shakespeare’s rallying speech as delivered at Agincourt. With our motet addressed jointly to St\n",
      "George and the Virgin Mary pleading for protection of the King and realm, we are ushered directly into the surroundings\n",
      "of Henry’s Chapel Royal via one of his own chapel musicians, John Cooke, who was among the musicians who\n",

      "Stephen’s Westminster, where Mass and Office were celebrated while the King was in the capital, survives today, the only\n",
      "building in the present-day Houses of Parliament to have survived the fire of 1834 more or less intact. (It also provided the\n",
      "model for the spatial layout of the Pugin-Barry main chamber at Westminster.)\n",
      "Thanks to the survival of contemporary chronicles we are unusually well informed about the practices of the Chapel and\n",
      "the likely role within it of motets. These give grounds for surmising that Cooke’s motet Alma proles/ Christi miles/ Ab inimicis\n",
      "nostris may have been composed for performance following the procession before Mass in Henry’s Chapel Royal. Its basis\n",
      "on a litany, Ab inimicis nostris defende nos Christe, typically said in time of war, also links it to our recessional number, which\n",

      "time.’\n",
      "This motet is one of a group that shares so much in terms of numerical organisation that it would be clear, even if we\n",

      "proles, Forest’s Ascendit Christus and the two grand motets by Dunstaple (Preco preheminencie and Veni Creator Spiritus/ Veni\n",
      "Sancte Spiritus), also functioned directly within the liturgy of the Chapel Royal. The latter two seemingly served as memorials\n",
      "performed after Compline respectively for St John the Baptist and the Holy Spirit, while Ascendit Christus may have\n",
      "performed the same function after Mass for the Assumption. The four motets are also linked by the lengths of their major\n",
      "sections and the numbers of syllables of their texts, with exact numerical correspondences and simple proportional ratios\n",
      "binding the pieces closely together, and presumably implying an overarching numerical symbolism.\n",
      "Gaude martyr, the first of two works in today’s concert by the gifted yet shadowy Forest, seems, as proposed by Robert\n",
      "Nosow, to be a rare survival of a motet for Edmund, King and Martyr, who met his end at the hands of the Danes in 970\n",
      "for refusing to renounce Christianity. As an early English royal martyr Edmund was clearly a focus of Lancastrian\n",
      "veneration, as revealed by John Lydgate’s presentation, in 1433, to Henry VI of a sumptuous Life of St. Edmund. Nosow\n",
      "reads the two texts of the motet as an allegory both of Henry V, ‘clothed in purple and crowned with victory,’ and his\n",
      "young son Henry VI, for whom Edmund, who was martyred at 14, would have presented a model of princely probity to a\n",
      "child monarch. He suggests, as an occasion for the motet, the knighting of the four-year-old Henry by his protector uncle\n",
      "John, Duke of Bedford at the (still surviving) church of St Mary de Castro in Leicester on 19 May 1426, an occasion\n",
      "intended to cement loyalty, in a divided country, to the young king.\n",
      "All these occasional works – with the exception of Ascendit Christus – are constructed according to the principle dubbed by\n",
      "modern scholarship isorhythm, a practice involving precise rhythmic and melodic schemes that repeat according to a series\n",
      "of arithmetical proportions, proceeding through carefully engineered diminutions, lending the pieces a strong sense of\n",
      "controlled forward momentum. These are works of glittering brilliance in which alternating individual parts shine forth\n",
      "kaleidoscopically from the whole as it proceeds, with the foundational tenor emerging increasingly into audibility with the\n",
      "progressive diminutions of its note values. The process is thus one of steady exegesis of the sacred melody on which the\n",
      "motets are based.\n",
      "Margaret Bent is currently assembling a convincing case to the effect that Sub arturo plebs, the famous ‘musicians’ motet’\n",
      "that frames a roll call of singers prominent at the time of its composition, is not, as used to be thought, a fourteenth-\n",
      "century work, but is in fact roughly contemporary with the dates, in the 1410s, of the motets already discussed. In this\n",
      "interpretation ‘Arthur/ Arcturus’ (the North Star) would be identified again directly with Henry V, certainly a worthy\n",
      "subject for the text’s claim that ‘the military flourishes with the clergy.’ One of the more complex and rigidly controlled\n",

      "exhilarating conclusion.\n",

      "seems reasonable to assume that it was the setting by Forest that filled this need. Unlike most of the other occasional\n",

      "of his fifteenth-century namesake in leading the English navy to victory and ‘preparing a way’ for his kingly brother.\n",

      "an essential component of the coronation ritual; and the words of the verse of the Trinity respond quoted in the tenor of\n",
      "the Mass would have been fitting for the occasion: ‘Give the rewards of joy, give the gifts of grace; loosen the chains of\n",

      "\"Five Sonnets and a Soliloquy\" by Eugene Drucker, texts by William Shakespeare\n",
      "Ever since I was a schoolboy, I’ve loved Shakespeare. It’s impossible to sing his praises without\n",
      "repeating what has been said thousands of times about the power and seductive beauty of his language\n",
      "and his deep insight into character and motivation. If I were an actor, there is nothing I would love more\n",
      "than to feel my voice transformed and galvanized by those resonant cadences. Since I am neither actor\n",
      "nor scholar, my only chance to interpret Shakespeare is through music.\n",
      "In these settings of five sonnets and a soliloquy from the first act of Hamlet, I have tried to imagine and\n",
      "notate as closely as possible the rhythms and pitch fluctuations of an expressive recitation. No syllable is\n",
      "prolonged beyond its speech value, and there are very few wide intervals between syllables; leaps and\n",
      "swoops are not natural characteristics of English speech. Every reader would have his or her own\n",
      "interpretation, resulting in tonal emphasis of different words within a line. My understanding of the texts\n",
      "has served as my compass when choosing meter and harmony.\n",
      "Sonnets 29 and 30 are plaintive and grief-stricken, but in the final couplet, each takes a turn toward a\n",
      "brighter view of things, paying homage to the dedicatee of the verse. Whether the sudden optimism was\n",
      "heartfelt or the mere fulfillment of a poetic convention is an interpretive matter; in a musical setting, this\n",
      "shift affords various possibilities for tone-painting. I move from dissonant harmonies toward an\n",
      "ambiguous tonality, following the change in mood but trying also to convey a modern, somewhat\n",
      "doubtful perspective on the happy ending. At the end of Sonnet 30, repeating a resonant phrase from the\n",
      "second line, I attempt to call into question the accuracy of remembrance by playing upon the meaning of\n",
      "the word “past”: “remembrance of things past … remembrance” – hoping to suggest that not only our\n",
      "memories but even our perceptions of the present may be skewed and that reality is beyond (“past”) our\n",
      "grasp. This moment is spoken rather than sung, but it is the only point in the whole cycle in which I\n",
      "depart from speech rhythm, allowing the voice to dwell nostalgically and enigmatically on a few\n",
      "syllables.\n",
      "Sonnet 81 promises immortality to the beloved through the power of its verse. I have chosen to begin\n",
      "this setting without an instrumental introduction, unlike the others, because the text seem to begin\n",
      "almost in mid-thought: “Or I shall live your epitaph to make / Or you survive when I in earth am rotten.”\n",
      "The view toward posterity is mediated by the death that will claim “all the breathers” of the poet’s own\n",
      "era. In a brief instrumental interlude before the triumphant final couplet, an insistent rhythmic motif in\n",
      "the cello is meant to evoke the passage of time and the fate that awaits us all.\n",
      "The jagged, violent portrayal of lust in Sonnet 129 has no happy turnaround in its final couplet, only a\n",
      "grim, sardonic summary of the trouble caused by lust. This poem abjures all lyricism; I have attempted\n",
      "to find a musical analogy to its pounding rhythms and stark imagery with a breathless pace and biting,\n",
      "dissonant harmonies. Sonnet 73, a melancholy, bittersweet meditation on the poet’s own mortality,\n",
      "concludes with a plea to be loved well in the face of the imminent, irrevocable separation that death will\n",
      "bring. The contrast between these two texts, and between the musical choices I have made in rendering\n",
      "them, could not be greater.\n",
      "To set the 48 lines of the soliloquy from the first act of Hamlet presented other challenges. The well-\n",
      "ordered structure of the sonnets (three quatrains plus the final couplet) is missing here. Instead we have a\n",
      "sort of stream of consciousness in iambic pentameter, with frequent digressions and exclamations,\n",
      "representing the somewhat disordered thought processes of the grief-stricken hero. The atmosphere is\n",
      "brooding and dramatic, bordering on the hysterical. I have pared the string quartet down to a trio, with\n",
      "only occasional contributions from the viola, so that the voice is suspended in a no-man’s-land between\n",
      "the violin and cello. This setting is even less of a “song” than my rendition of the sonnets, and the\n",
      "overall musical structure will be less easily grasped as I follow and respond to the lurching lines of\n",
      "thought and feeling with which Hamlet first exposes his soul’s torment.\n",
      "Sonnet 29\n",
      "When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\n",

      "Overture to Candide\n",
      "Leonard Bernstein’s operetta Candide was based on the novella of the same name by French\n",
      "writer, philosopher and historian, Voltaire. The original novella, published in 1752, criticized Leibniz’s\n",
      "philosophy of “Optimism,” causing a scandal due to the religious blasphemy and subversive political\n",
      "ideas. It was a huge success and subsequently widely translated. In the novella, Candide is the\n",
      "illegitimate nephew of a German baron Thunder-Ten-Tronck. He grows up in the baron’s castle under\n",
      "the tutelage of the scholar Pangloss, who teaches him that this world is “the best of all possible\n",
      "worlds.” Candide falls in love with the baron’s young daughter, Cunégonde. The baron catches the two\n",
      "kissing and expels Candide from his home. It isn't long before his experiences wandering the world\n",
      "put his optimistic views to a severe test.\n",
      "The first performance of Bernstein’s operetta, with a libretto by Lillian Hellman, was\n",
      "performed in 1956 and was criticized as to serious and too bitter. The second libretto, by Hugh\n",
      "Wheeler (1976), is in use today and is considered more faithful to the original. The Overture to\n",
      "Candide has become one of the most widely performed orchestral compositions by a 20th century\n",
      "composer. The overture includes the “Battle Music” (first heard in the trumpets and trombones) the\n",
      "love duet of Candide and Cuneguende, “Oh, Happy We, “ (first heard in the violas and clarinets,)\n",
      "Cundegunde’s well known aria “Glitter and Be Gay,”(heard towards the end of the overture, with solo\n",
      "flutes, trumpet and horns), as well as some music written specifically for the overture.\n",
      "Symphony #8 in G Major, Op 88, (1889) Antonín Dvořák\n",
      "Many influential musicians of Germany, the Austrian empire and English speaking countries during\n",
      "the 19th century considered Dvořák second to Brahms as the greatest living composer. However, by\n",
      "the mid-1920’s the dismantling of the established syntax of western music by progressive composers\n",
      "such as Busoni and Schoenberg, cast Dvořák’s music as “unoriginal,“ and “sentimental”. The popularity\n",
      "of many of Dvořák’s works such as his Cello Concerto, Slavonic Dances and Symphony # 9, the “New\n",
      "World,” and his Symphony #8, furthered this view. While Brahms was regarded as ‘one of the\n",
      "“greats” of music,’ Dvořák was considered, particularly in Germany, as belonging to a nationally more\n",
      "limited niche.\n",
      "Written between August 26 and November 8 of 1889, the Symphony #8, (at one point known\n",
      "as Symphony #4) was written during an idyllic period of the composer’s life. By this time Dvořák had\n",
      "achieved popular success with his Slavonic Dances, and was given his due as a ‘serious’ composer, after\n",
      "performances of his Symphony No. 7 in d minor commissioned for the Philharmonic Society of London\n",
      "and considered a mark of his ‘expressive maturity’. This confidence along with a grant from the\n",
      "Austrian government made it conducive to artistic work. In addition, his garden in Vysoká and the\n",
      "nearby fields and woods brought him the inspiration and peace of mind that seems to be the stimulus\n",
      "of this lovely Symphony.\n",
      "At one point while sketching the first movement Dvořák remarked to a friend, that his head\n",
      "was so full of ideas that he could hardly get them all down. Not surprisingly, Brahms, though a\n",
      "supporter and friend of Dvořák, wrote that in the Eighth Symphony, there is “[T]oo much that’s\n",
      "fragmentary, incidental, loiters about in the piece. Everything is fine, musically captivating and\n",
      "beautiful—but no main points! Especially in the first movement, the result is not proper.“ Nonetheless\n",
      "this bucolic, lyrical and sunny work is a favorite among audiences and many musicians today.\n",

      "Sinfonia from the Opera Norma by Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835)\n",
      "Known for his melodic lines and influence on Chopin, the Italian opera composer, Vincenzo Bellini was named,\n",
      "“the Swan of Catania,” and praised by Guiseppe Verdi for his “extremely long melodies as no-one else had even\n",
      "made before.” Born in the Sicilian city of Catania, his grandfather was a composer and organist and his first music\n",
      "instructor. A child prodigy, it is said Bellini could sing an aria before he was two years old and to conduct at age\n",
      "three. Though these stories were most likely exaggerated, he probably started to compose and play the piano\n",
      "around the age of six. Written after the play, Norma, ou L’infanticide [Norma, or the Infanticide,] Vincenzo\n",
      "Bellini’s Norma is a tragedia lirica in two acts and is a leading example of bel canto style. The libretto, written by\n",
      "Felice Romani, required many re-writes before Bellini was satisfied. The prayer Casta diva, sung by the leading\n",
      "soprano role, is one of the most famous arias of the 19th century. First produced at La Scala in Milan on\n",

      "Act One\n",
      "Bellini’s Opera Norma takes place in Gaul around 50 BCE during the Roman occupation. The opera opens at\n",
      "night in a forest as the priest of the Druids, Oroveso, leads his people in a prayer seeking revenge against the\n",
      "Romans. Oroveso’s daughter, the high priestess Norma, has had two children with Roman proconsul Pollione, so\n",
      "in sympathy she tells the people not to seek revenge. As the Druids assemble, Norma prays to the moon goddess\n",
      "in the famous aria, “Casta diva,” telling her people that the Romans will self-destruct. However, Pollione has\n",
      "fallen in love with the young priestess Adalgisa. Adalgisa, conflicted about her affair with Pollione, tries to resist\n",
      "him, but she gives in and renounces her vows after he pleads with her to come to Rome with him. Norma\n",
      "confides in her servant, Clotilde, that Pollione has been recalled to Rome and she is afraid he will he desert her\n",
      "and the children. Adalgisa comes to Norma and confesses her love affair with a Roman. Norma, recalling her own\n",
      "affair, releases her from her vows and asks who he is. On upon finding it is Pollione she is furious and tells\n",
      "Adalgisa of Pollione’s betrayal. After Pollione again confesses his love for her, Adalgisa refuses to go away with\n",
      "him and vows she would rather die than steal him from Norma.\n",
      "Act Two\n",
      "Norma tries to bring herself to murder her children rather than have them live in disgrace without a father.\n",
      "Instead she tells Adalgisa to marry Pollione and take her children. Adalgisa refuses and says she will only go to\n",
      "Pollione to try to persuade him to come back to Norma. After the Druids hear that there will be a new\n",

      "Romans. Oroveso demands a sacrificial victim just as Pollione has been brought in having profaned the sanctuary.\n",
      "Alone with him, Norma promises him his freedom if he will leave Adalgisa and return to her. When he refuses,\n",
      "she threatens to kill him, their children and Adalgisa. Calling in the Druids, she tells them a guilty priestess must\n",

      "Swedish premiere Bergman said he hoped “the audience would understand and would leave the theater with a\n",
      "definite felt experience or a suddenly acquired thought.” The primary subject of the film is a pastor of a small\n",

      "He is unable to comfort a parishioner who is obsessed with fear of the atomic bomb and coldly rejects his\n",
      "mistress’s pleas for marriage. The film is said to consolidate Bergman’s recurring themes;å the nature of existence,\n",
      "God’s silence and the nature of love.\n",
      "This composition is not meant to reflect in any programmatic way the narrative of the film, though it begins and\n",
      "ends with the same musical material just as the film begins and ends with two church scenes. The film itself is a\n",

      "L’Oiseau de Feu, The Firebird, Suite from the Ballet, re-orchestrated 1919, by Igor Stravinsky\n",
      "Stravinsky’s reputation was made overnight when Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes gave the first performance of Firebird\n",
      "on 25 June 1910. But he was actually fourth or possibly fifth in line, after Cherepnin, Lyadov, and Glazonov as a\n",
      "choice for a composer for Firebird. Stravinsky’s first forays into ballet were actually orchestrations of Chopin, for\n",
      "Mikhail Fokine’s Ballet Chopiniana, later renamed Le Sylphides for a production in June, 1909 in Paris. Wanting\n",
      "to align himself with the international school that at that point in history was associated with the success of\n",
      "composers such as Debussy, Dukas and Ravel, Stravinsky downplayed the Russian aspects his music. However,\n",
      "his three great ballets, Firebird, Petrouchka and The Rite of Spring owe considerable influence to the Russian\n",
      "school. Much of Stravinsky’s compositional style can be seen in Modest Mussorgsky’s abrupt junctions,\n",
      "repetition of melodic cells, whole tone sets, and octatonic scales. Octatonic and whole tone sets are outgrowths of\n",
      "the circle of thirds that are also seen in works such as Schubert Symphony No. 4 and Rimsky Korsakov’s\n",
      "Scheherazade, both recently performed by the Bi-College Orchestra. These became modulatory devices for Russian\n",
      "composers at the time, and as well as a representation of the evocation of evil magic. Also derived from Rimsky\n",
      "Korsakov and the Russian School, is the use of diatonicism and folk-song related motives and themes to depict\n",
      "the good or human. This is most evident in the Rondo of the Princesses, and the concluding movement of the Suite,\n",
      "the Final.\n",
      "The plot of The Firebird was derived in part from a poem by Yakov Polensky that takes a variety of Skázka\n",
      "(Russian fairy tales, folk tales) elements including the Prince Charming hero, “Ivan –Tsarevich,” the ‘Sorcerer-\n",
      "tsar” and antagonist Kaschey the Deathless, But the structure of the fairy tale is changed and the heart of the\n",
      "transformation is its moral import – ‘a fairy tale for grown ups.’ Prior tales of the Firebird could be viewed\n",
      "as “fantasies of selfish gratification, earned through supernatural intervention.” In contrast Ivan’s magical\n",
      "assistance is a reward for his “Christian like piety,” as his mission was one of rescue rather than greed. Although\n",
      "the Firebird subject was cliché, there was no story in which she was the central character. The firebird signified\n",
      "the indifference of beauty to the desires and cares of mankind and as a symbol of arts for arts sake, a rallying point\n",
      "for the neo-nationalists and symbolist movement in Russian. What was unprecedented in Stravinsky’s Firebird\n",
      "was not the music, but aspects of the ballet itself. Fokine, the choreographer, earned his reputation as a reformer\n",
      "who wanted to raise the standard of ballet to that of opera by giving it deeper dramatic value. Russian ballet prior\n",
      "to Firebird was a sequence of dances with the thinnest possible plot culminating in a final act that was merely a\n",
      "collection of dances. Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker follows this paradigm, and one of the reasons the initial failure of\n",
      "his Swan Lake (to be performed by the Bi-College Orchestra this coming spring) was the avoidance of the\n",
      "characteristic final act. In the Firebird Ballet, there is mimetic action were the dancers are not actually dancing but\n",
      "miming action of the stage. Particularly noticeable in The Firebird Ballet is the lack of dancing in the last act. This\n",
      "avoidance of the usual collection of dances was Stravinsky’s conception and one of the few of he insisted on.\n",
      "The ballet begins with Tsarevitch Ivan, who, while out hunting is drawn to the glittering Firebird that he spies in\n",
      "Kastchei's enchanted garden. After he traps her, they dance a powerful pas de deux as she struggles in his\n",
      "grasp. In return for giving him her freedom, she leaves him a magic feather with which he can recall her strength\n",
      "in his time of need. A group of young Princesses—Kastchei's captives—enters the garden to dance in the\n",
      "moonlight, and Ivan and the loveliest Princess are drawn to one another (Rondo of the Princesses). With the\n",
      "approach of the dawn, the Princesses return to the castle, warning Ivan to escape before Kastchei appears. Not yet\n",
      "understanding the power of the enemy, Ivan tries to follow. The Prince is suddenly confronted by Katscheï's\n",
      "horrible servants, and ultimately, the magician himself. He is threatened by Kastchei's monsters, and incurs his\n",
      "wrath. Kashchei's monstrous servants capture him, and are about to transform him into stone, but the hero\n",
      "produces the Firebird's magic feather. The Firebird appears and tells him the secret of Kashchei’s immortality: his\n",
      "spirit in the form of an egg that he keeps in coffer, must remain intact. After the Firebird induces the sleep of\n",
      "Katscheï and her captives in a frenetic dance (Danse Infernale) Ivan opens the coffer and breaks the magic egg;\n",

      "celebration follows, (Final) as the maiden Ivan loves, princess Tsarevna, and the prince marry.\n",
      "Stravinsky arranged three Suites of the ballet for the concert stage. The first, called Suite tirée du conte dansé,\n",
      "“L’oiseau de feu’’ was made in 1911 and published by Jurgenson in 1912. The orchestration follows closely the\n",
      "ballet score, with slight modification to provide endings for the movements. The 1919 version is most commonly\n",
      "performed today and is arranged for reduced instrumentation as the original ballet was written for an usually large\n",
      "number of instruments. The Third Suite was made in 1945 and again was written for a similar reduced orchestra\n",
      "as the 1919 Suite.\n",
      "Symphony #100 in G Major the “Military Symphony” by Franz Joseph Haydn\n",
      "Though in some respects an irritating cliché, Franz Joseph Haydn’s nickname as the ‘father of the symphony’ is\n",
      "more than fitting. Not only are his symphonies of historical importance in the development of the genre, but\n",
      "having written over 100 symphonies, the vast output and range is seldom matched by other composers in Western\n",
      "art music. By the 1790’s Haydn was living in Vienna as a respected and well-known composer. Prior to this he\n",
      "was Kappellmeister in Eisenstadt and Esterháza for almost thirty years. When in September 1790 the London\n",
      "impresario and violinist, Johann Peter Salomon, asked Haydn to compose and conduct the symphonies that\n",
      "became known as his “London” Symphonies, he knew he would be writing for the more cosmopolitan and\n",
      "exacting audience of London. Musical life in London, as opposed to feudal Austria, was more open, competitive\n",
      "and sensitive to market forces. Spurred on by these circumstances, these Symphonies, nos. 93 - 104, are\n",
      "considered his highest achievement in the genre. The popularity of these works now as well as then, is achieved\n",
      "by the apparently simple themes, the “rustic” style of some of the movements, and Haydn’s use of humor. Yet the\n",
      "more popular elements in these works are set in a firm, formal construction that, while not breaking any new\n",
      "ground, involve a complexity and variety in their structure that some theorists consider greater than the\n",
      "symphonic works of Mozart. These symphonies also show more daring harmonic conceptions and rhythmic\n",
      "drive. Haydn expands the instrumentation, with clarinets in all but one of the last six symphonies. In search of\n",
      "the novel and unexpected there is a sudden offbeat fortissimo crash in the slow movement of Symphony No. 94,\n",
